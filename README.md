# CriticMarkup plugin for Obsidian

A [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) renderer for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for
collaborative editing and reviewing your notes. Includes a suggestion mode for keeping track of changes, and a comment mode for easily leaving comments.

This plugin was built upon the excellent work and advice of @kometenstaub, the original repositories can be found here: [CriticMarkup plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/obsidian-criticmarkup)
and [CriticMarkup parser](https://github.com/kometenstaub/lang-criticmarkup).

Roadmap for full product can be found below. No timeline will be given for when (and in which order)
these features will be implemented. If features prove to be completely infeasible to implement, they will be removed from the roadmap.

The plugin _is_ available for beta testing, but please keep in mind that you should not use this plugin in
your main vault. There is a non-zero risk of text being removed when using e.g. the suggestion mode.

Please report any errors or bug you encounter, especially when these result in loss of data or cause
crashes/malfuctions in Obsidian. In the [Obsidian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd), there is a thread
under `Extensions > Plugin Advanced > Commentator`, you can report bugs there, or in the [Github issues page](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-criticmarkup/issues).

### Developing
To set up a development environment, please follow the following instructions:
1. Install the `bun` package manager from https://bun.sh/
2. Clone this repository (`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-criticmarkup.git`)
3. Run `bun install` in the root of the repository to install all dependencies
4. Run `bun run build:dev` to build the plugin. This will also reload the plugin in your currently active Obsidian vault
5. (_Optional_) If you want the plugin to reload on every build, use `bun run build:dev:hr` instead. For this, you will need to install the [Obsidian CLI](https://obsidian.md/cli).

### Parser

- [x] Parsing of CriticMarkup syntax (see [CriticMarkup parser library](https://github.com/Fevol/criticmarkup-parser/))

  - [x] Via command palette (entire document/selection)
  - [x] Via context menu (selection)
  - [x] Via gutter markings (line)

#### Extensions

- [ ] Automatically correct invalid markup
- [ ] Automatically simplify dangling and (partially) empty markup

#### Suggestion View

- [x] Vault-wide index of all suggestions and comments
  - [x] Automatically create/re-synchronize on vault opening
  - [x] Keep up-to-date with immediate changes in vault
- [x] Custom view for viewing suggestions and comments over entire vault
  - [x] Metadata rendering
  - [ ] Filter by recency
  - [ ] Filter by author (see also custom syntax)

  - [x] UIX/Scrolling improvements

- [ ] Toggling comment mode on/off in editor
- [ ] Integration of toggles for suggestion mode, preview and comment mode with other community plugins
- [ ] Specify suggestion/comment-only mode in frontmatter (based on authorship)

### Rendering

- [x] Rendering of markup in Live Preview
- [x] Rendering of markup in Reading View (Postprocessor)
- [x] Rendering comments
  - [x] In right-side gutter of document
  - [x] On hover in document

### Syntax

- [x] Extend CriticMarkup syntax to allow for authorship and timestamp annotation
- [x] Extend `Comment` markup to support comment threads
- [x] Choice comments: offer several candidate wordings for a single suggestion (see below)
- [ ] Allow custom highlight colours for `Highlight` markup

#### Choice comments

A comment attached directly to a `Substitution` or `Highlight` whose first line starts with `pick:` turns that suggestion
into a resolvable choice. Options are separated by `|`, may carry an optional `(a)`-style label, and `____` marks a blank
for a custom replacement. Any further lines are shown as a note.

```text
{~~the model shows~>the results indicate~~}{>>pick: (a) the results indicate | (b) we find | (c) ____
reason: hedge less<<}
```

Resolve these via the `Resolve suggested edits with choices` command, the `Resolve choice…` entry in the gutter/comment
context menus, or from the global annotation view. Picking an option or typing a custom replacement writes that text into
the document and removes the suggestion and its comment thread; rejecting restores the original text. Skipped items are left
untouched, and the markup stays valid CriticMarkup for other tools.

### Suggestion Mode

- [x] Converting edit operations into appropriate markings
- [ ] Correct cursor placement through edit and cursor operations
  - [x] Support different options for cursor movement (always stop when markup encountered, ...)
  - [ ] Full Vim Support
- [ ] Toggle sequential CM state updating for improved multi-cursor support when inserting/deleting

### Comment Mode

- [ ] Add comments to selection
- [x] Smooth cursor movement through markup
